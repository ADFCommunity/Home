# ADF Community

The ADF Community is a place for users of Azure Data Factory to share code that can help the rest of the community.

## Projects

To see a list of all projects, see the [ADFCommunity account page](https://github.com/ADFCommunity). Key projects are:

* [Build Tools](https://github.com/ADFCommunity/Adfc.Msbuild)

The build tools are separated from the Visual Studio extension, so that build servers without Visual Studio installed, or without the extension installed, can still build the project.

* [Visual Studio extension](https://github.com/ADFCommunity/Adfc.VisualStudio.Extensions)

The Visual Studio extension that adds support for the project system and new project and item templates.
